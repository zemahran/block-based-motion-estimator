### Description

This is a backward prediction block-based motion estimator utilizing the spiral full search algorithm.
The testing was done on two 288 Ã— 352 luminance frames adopted from [The Akiyo News Broadcast](https://media.xiph.org/video/derf/).
The second frame is used to generate a prediction (residual frame and motion vectors) for the first one.
